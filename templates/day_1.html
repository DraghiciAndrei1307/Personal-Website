    Before we dive in the subject we will discuss today, I just want to give a little bit of context. So, the main
    project that I am working on is creating this personal website, the one that you are currently on at the present
    moment. In order to create this website, I had to follow a specialized course from Udemy, namely
    <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=CP251118G4V2">
        "100 Days of Code™: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"</a> , created by Dr. Angela Yu.

    What I wanted to learn at first was only Python, but this course widened my horizons and showed me that I can do so
    much more. One of the things that I enjoyed the most, as you are probably guessing, was creating web applications,
    like this one. I think that this is a great opportunity to create something technical, but at the same time express
    your creativity.
</p>

<p>
    But creating just a website was not enough for me. Why? Because I enjoy understanding the big picture in everything
    that I put my hands on. So, I started asking myself "Where I will host this website?". The answers to that question
    were many, but in the end, I got to the conclusion that I want to create a home server of my own where I will host
    this web application. But creating a home server implies ensuring its security. To ensure security means that you
    have cover 3 big concepts: application-side security, server-side security and local network side security. I know,
    that is a huge objective to achieve, but I really like the idea of learning how to create a home server to host my
    web application and to ensure its security. It is like creating yourself a kingdom which you have to defend. I know
    that, at the moment, I am just a newbie in both web dev and cyber-security, but "Rome wasn't built in a day".
</p>

<p>
    Even though I finished my Bachelor's Degree in Automatic Control and Computer Science, I still lack the necessary
    knowledge in securing a server. And I thought to myself, before I start to learn about security, first I have to
    fill the knowledge gaps regarding the management of a Linux OS (to be more precise: RedHat 9 LinuxOS).

        <h3>Coming back to the subject of today's discussion</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
        Today I learned about how to schedule jobs on a server provisioned with RedHat 9. There are 3 ways you can
        achieve that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using Systemd time units</li>
        <li>Using the old, but awesome, crond</li>
        <li>To be continued</li>
    </ul>
